    `{user} could start an argument in an empty room and still lose it.`,
    `{user}'s ideas are like their hairline — always receding.`,
    `{user} is like a software update: nobody asked for them and they always show up at the worst time.`,
    `If {user} were any more underwhelming, they'd be a loading screen.`,
    `{user} is the human equivalent of a participation trophy.`,
    `{user} has the personality of unseasoned plain rice — and not even warm rice.`,
    `{user} is so slow they get lapped by parked cars.`,
    `{user} is like a pop-up ad — unwanted, annoying, and impossible to take seriously.`,
    `{user}'s jokes are like their future: short, dark, and nobody's laughing.`,
    `{user} brings so little to the table, they showed up without a chair.`,
    `{user} is the reason instructions have to say "step 1."`,
    `{user} could trip over a wireless connection.`,

    `{user} is so basic they make plain toast look exciting.`,
    `{user} has exactly two modes: offline and useless.`,
